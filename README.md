## Why LeetCode?
- **Sharpening Skills**: It's the perfect place to keep my coding skills razor-sharp.
- **Learning New Techniques**: Every problem is a new lesson, teaching me more about algorithms and data structures.
- **Having Fun**: Yes, solving problems can be funâ€”like a treasure hunt, but with more coffee and fewer pirates.

### A Little Humor to Brighten Your Day

- **Why do programmers prefer dark mode?**  
  Because light attracts bugs!

- **Why do Java developers wear glasses?**  
  Because they donâ€™t see sharp.

- **How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?**  
  None, thatâ€™s a hardware problem!
